<h1>Dice Games</h1>
<p> If you have reached this page I appreciate your tenacity and apologize for the dissapointment.  The free Heroku instance I use was not designed for big data problems.  It only stores a little amount of data, 10,000 entries.  Something fun might show up here some day. I went to the exploratorium and saw they had a game to teach the law of large numbers using a coin toss.  I felt inspired to build this simple dice game demonstrating the same principle.</p>
